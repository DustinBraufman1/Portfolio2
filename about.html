                My name is Dustin Braufman and I am currently a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in Marketing.
                I enjoy combining my experience in Design and Marketing to create and optimize everything from social media content to full functioning websites.

                I have worked across digital, print, and out of home mediums alike. My professional work spans social media posts, digital and print ads, brochures,
                brand materials, and more.
